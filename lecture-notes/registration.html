<h3 id="matchingsurfacesthatshareaparameterization">Matching surfaces that share a parameterization</h3>

<p>For example, consider if a surface <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is given with a parameterization so that
each point on <span class="math">\(X\)</span> can be written as a function of parameters <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(\x(u,v) ∈ X\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> is another surface produced by the same parameterization
(<span class="math">\(\y(u,v) ∈ Y\)</span>), then we can think of <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> as a <em>deformation</em> of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> (or
vice-versa). Each point <span class="math">\(\y(u,v)\)</span> on the surface <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> has a natural
corresponding point <span class="math">\(\x(u,v)\)</span> on <span class="math">\(X\)</span> via the parameters <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span>.</p>

<figcaption>The surface of a Beetle is <em>deformed</em> into a new surface. The
parameterization of the original surface allows us to identify the
corresponding points on the deformed surface.
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/">image source</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A very natural way to <em>measure</em> the difference between these two surfaces
<em>aggregate</em> the distance between each pair of corresponding points. For
example, we could <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral">integrate</a> this
distance over the parametric domain
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_loss_of_generality">w.l.o.g.</a> let&#8217;s say
valid values are <span class="math">\(u,v ∈ (0,1)\)</span>):</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
D_2(X,Y) = \sqrt{ ∫_0^1∫_0^1 ‖\x(u,v) - \y(u,v)‖² \;du\;dv }
\]</span></p>

<p>This measure will be zero if the surfaces are the same for any choice of
parameters <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span>. The measure <span class="math">\(D_2(X,Y)\)</span> could large if every point on
<span class="math">\(Y\)</span> is <em>slightly</em> deformed or if a few bad points are deformed a lot. This
distance is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Infinite-dimensional_case">L²
norm</a>
of the magnitude of the <em>displacement</em> from <span class="math">\(X\)</span> to <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> (or vice-versa):</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
D_2(X,Y) = \sqrt{ ∫_0^1∫_0^1 d(u,v)² \;du\;dv }, \quad \text{ and } \quad d(u,v) = ‖\x(u,v) -
\y(u,v)‖
\]</span></p>

<p>We can directly measure the <em>maximum</em> distance between corresponding
points, the <span class="math">\(L^∞\)</span> norm:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
D_∞(X,Y) = \lim_{p→∞} \sqrt[p]{∫_0^1∫_0^1 d(u,v)^p \;du\;dv } = \sup\limits_{u,v ∈
(0,1)} ‖\x(u,v) - \y(u,v)‖,
\]</span></p>

<p>where <span class="math">\(\sup\)</span> takes the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum_and_supremum">supremum</a> (roughly the continuous math
analog of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima">maximum</a>).</p>

<p>The measure <span class="math">\(D_∞\)</span> will also be exactly zero if the surfaces are the same.</p>

<h4 id="trianglemeshes">Triangle meshes</h4>

<p>On the computer, we can store an explicit surface as a triangle mesh. Triangle
meshes have an <em>implicit</em> parameterization: each triangle can be trivially
and independently mapped to the unit triangle, via its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinate_system#Barycentric_coordinates_on_triangles">barycentric
coordinates</a>.</p>

<p>Triangle meshes also afford an immediate analog of deformation: moving each
vertex of the mesh (without change the mesh combinatorics/topology).</p>

<p>So if <span class="math">\(\V_X ∈ \R^{n × 3}\)</span> represents the vertices of our surface <span class="math">\(X\)</span> with a set
<span class="math">\(F\)</span> of <span class="math">\(m\)</span>
triangular faces and <span class="math">\(\V_Y ∈ \R^{n × 3}\)</span> the vertices of deformed surface <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>,
then we can rewrite our measure <span class="math">\(D_2\)</span> above as a sum of integrals over each
triangle:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
∑\limits_{\{i,j,k\} ∈ T}  \sqrt{ ∫_0^{1-u} ∫_0^1 
\left\|
\underbrace{\left(u \v_x^i + v \v_x^j + (1-u-v) \v_x^k\right)}_\x
-
\underbrace{\left(u \v_y^i + v \v_y^j + (1-u-v) \v_y^k\right)}_\y
\right\|^2 \;du\;dv }
\]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>areas</em> of the triangles in our mesh may be different. So this
measure may be thrown off by a very large triangle with a small difference
and may fail to measure a very small triangle with a large difference. We&#8217;ll
learn how to account for this, later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, in many scenarios we do not have two co-parameterized surface or
a simple per-vertex mesh deformation. Instead, we may have two arbitrary
surfaces discretized with different meshes of different
topologies. We will need a measure of difference or distance between two
surfaces that does not assume a shared parameterization.</p>

<h3 id="undirectedhausdorffdistance">(undirected) Hausdorff distance</h3>

<p>To form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metric</a> in the
mathematical sense, a distance measure should be symmetric: distance from <span class="math">\(X\)</span>
to <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> equals distance from <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> to <span class="math">\(X\)</span>. Hausdorff distance is defined as the
maximum of directed Haurdorff distances:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
D_{H}(X,Y) = \max \left[ D_{\overrightarrow{H}}(X,Y)\ , \ D_{\overrightarrow{H}}(Y,X) \right].
\]</span></p>

<p>Unlike each individual directed distance, the (undirected) Hausdorff distance
will measure zero <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if">if and only
if</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#Balls.2C_spheres.2C_and_hypersurfaces">point
set</a>
of the surface <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is identical to that of <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>.</p>

<h4 id="hausdorffdistancebetweentrianglemeshes">Hausdorff distance between triangle meshes</h4>

<p>On the computer, surfaces represented with triangle meshes (like any point set)
admit a well-defined Hausdorff distance between one-another. Unfortunately,
computing <em>exact</em> Hausdorff distance between two triangle meshes remains a
difficult task: existing exact algorithms are prohibitively inefficient.</p>

<p>We do not know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori"><em>a
priori</em></a> which
point(s) of each triangle mesh will end up determining the maximum value. It is
tempting, optimistic, but ultimately incorrect to assume that the <em>generator</em>
points will be one of the vertices of the triangle mesh. Consider if a triangle
<span class="math">\(t\)</span> connected corners at <span class="math">\((1,1,0)\)</span>, <span class="math">\((1,0,1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((0,1,1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> was a mesh
with two triangles, the first connecting <span class="math">\((0,0,0)\)</span>, <span class="math">\((1,0,1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((1,1,0)\)</span> and
the second connecting <span class="math">\((0,0,0)\)</span>, <span class="math">\((0,1,1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((1,1,0)\)</span>. The corners of <span class="math">\(t\)</span>
also appear as vertices of <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, so clearly their respective vertex-to-mesh
distances are zero, yet the maximum minimum distance from <span class="math">\(t\)</span> to <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is clearly
non-zero (it is <span class="math">\(\sqrt{3}/3\)</span>).</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/hausdorff-counterexample-3d.jpg" alt="The directed Hausdorff distance from the orange triangle $A$ to
the blue, two-triangle mesh $B$ is non-zero (generated by red segment), but the
distance from each corner of $A$ to $B$ is
zero." />
<figcaption>The directed Hausdorff distance from the orange triangle <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to
the blue, two-triangle mesh <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is non-zero (generated by red segment), but the
distance from each corner of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is
zero.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One might also optimistically, but erroneously hope that by considering the
symmetric Hausdorff distance one of the <em>generator</em> points must lie on a vertex
of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> or of <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. Unfortunately, this only follows for convex shapes.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/hausdorff-non-convex-2d.png" alt="The directed Hausdorff distance to the blue alligator shape
in 2D from its orange convex hull is generated by non-vertex points. Since
the symmetric Hausdorff distance is the maximum of this and the smaller
distance from the blue shape to the orange shape, it is also generated by these
non-vertex points." />
<figcaption>The directed Hausdorff distance <em>to</em> the blue &#8220;alligator&#8221; shape

distance from the blue shape to the orange shape, it is also generated by these
non-vertex points.</figcaption>

<h2 id="integratedclosest-pointdistance">Integrated closest-point distance</h2>

<h2 id="symmetricmatchingdistance">Symmetric matching distance</h2>

<p>We can similarly define a symmetric distance by <em>summing</em> the two directed
distances:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
D_{C}(X,Y) = 
D_{\overrightarrow{C}}(X,Y) +
D_{\overrightarrow{C}}(Y,X) = 
\sqrt{\ ∫\limits_{\x∈X} ‖\x - P_Y(\x) ‖² \;dA }+
\sqrt{\ ∫\limits_{\y∈Y} ‖\y - P_X(\y) ‖² \;dA }.
\]</span></p>

<h2 id="unconstrainedicp">Unconstrained ICP</h2>

<p>If we place no restrictions or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_optimization">constraints</a> on the
transformation <span class="math">\(T: \R³ → \R³\)</span>, then there are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triviality_(mathematics)">trivial
solutions</a> to
minimizing <span class="math">\(E_{\overrightarrow{C}}(T(X),Y)\)</span>. For example, we could simply
define <span class="math">\(T\)</span> so that every point <span class="math">\(\x\)</span> gets mapped to its closest point on <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>:
<span class="math">\(T(\x) := P_Y(\x)\)</span>. This would clearly induce <span class="math">\(E_{\overrightarrow{C}}=0\)</span>.
Actually, we could get zero energy even if we define <span class="math">\(T\)</span> to map <em>all</em> points on
<span class="math">\(X\)</span> to the same <em>arbitrary</em> point on <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>: <span class="math">\(T(\x) := \y\)</span>.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="symmetricenergyforcompletematches">Symmetric energy for complete matches</h3>

<p>If <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> are <em>complete</em> matches, then one way to remove these trivial
solutions is to minimize the symmetric energy summing energies from <span class="math">\(X\)</span> to <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>
and from <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> to <span class="math">\(X\)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
E_C(T(X),Y) = E_{\overrightarrow{C}}(T(X),Y) + E_{\overrightarrow{C}}(Y,T(X)).
\]</span></p>

<p>Appending the energy <span class="math">\(E_{\overrightarrow{C}}(Y,T(X))\)</span> measure the distance
from all points on <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> to the transformed surface <span class="math">\(T(X)\)</span> ensures that we will
not get zero energy if some part of <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> does not get matched to some part of
<span class="math">\(X\)</span>.</p>
